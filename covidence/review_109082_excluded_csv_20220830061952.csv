Association of mitochondrial variants and haplogroups identified by whole exome sequencing with Alzheimer's disease.,Zhang X.; Farrell JJ.; Tong T.; Hu J.; Zhu C.;  .; Wang LS.; Mayeux R.; Haines JL.; Pericak-Vance MA.; Schellenberg GD.; Lunetta KL.; Farrer LA.,"Findings regarding the association between mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variants and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are inconsistent. We developed a pipeline for accurate assembly and variant calling in mitochondrial genomes embedded within whole exome sequences (WES) from 10,831 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP). Association of AD risk was evaluated with each mtDNA variant and variants located in 1158 nuclear genes related to mitochondrial function using the SCORE test. Gene-based tests were performed using SKAT-O. Analysis of 4220 mtDNA variants revealed study-wide significant association of AD with a rare MT-ND4L variant (rs28709356 C>T; minor allele frequency = 0.002; P = 7.3 × 10-5 ) as well as with MT-ND4L in a gene-based test (P = 6.71 × 10-5 ). Significant association was also observed with a MT-related nuclear gene, TAMM41, in a gene-based test (P = 2.7 × 10-5 ). The expression of TAMM41 was lower in AD cases than controls (P = .00046) or mild cognitive impairment cases (P = .03). Significant findings in MT-ND4L and TAMM41 provide evidence for a role of mitochondria in AD.",2022,02,Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association,18,2,294-306,,10.1002/alz.12396,34152079,#1728,Zhang 2022,Exclusion reason: Wrong study design; ,""
Whole-Exome Sequencing Analysis of Alzheimer's Disease in Non-APOE*4 Carriers.,Fan KH.; Feingold E.; Rosenthal SL.; Demirci FY.; Ganguli M.; Lopez OL.; Kamboh MI.,"The genetics of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) is complex due to the heterogeneous nature of the disorder. APOE*4 is the strongest genetic risk factor for AD. Genome-wide association studies have identified more than 30 additional loci, each having relatively small effect size. Known AD loci explain only about 30% of the genetic variance, and thus much of the genetic variance remains unexplained. To identify some of the missing heritability of AD, we analyzed whole-exome sequencing (WES) data focusing on non-APOE*4 carriers from two WES datasets: 720 cases and controls from the University of Pittsburgh and 7,252 cases and controls from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project. Following separate WES analyses in each dataset, we performed meta-analysis for overlapping markers present in both datasets. Among the four variants reaching the exome-wide significance threshold, three were from known AD loci: APOE/rs7412 (odds ratio (OR) = 0.40; p = 5.46E-24), TOMM40/rs157581 (OR = 1.49; p = 4.04E-07), and TREM2/rs75932628 (OR = 4.00; p = 1.15E-07). The fourth significant variant, rs199533, was from a novel locus on chromosome 17 in the NSF gene (OR = 0.78; p = 2.88E-07). NSF was also significant in the gene-based analysis (p = 1.20E-05). In the GTEx data, NSF/rs199533 is a cis-eQTL for multiple genes in the brain and blood, including NSF that is highly expressed across all brain tissues, including regions that typically show amyloid-β accumulation. Further characterization of genes that are affected by NSF/rs199533 may help to shed light on the roles of these genes in AD etiology.",2020,,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,76,4,1553-1565,,10.3233/JAD-200037,32651314,#1637,Fan 2020,Exclusion reason: Wrong study design; ,""
"Non-coding variants in MYH11, FZD3, and SORCS3 are associated with dementia in women.",Blue EE.; Thornton TA.; Kooperberg C.; Liu S.; Wactawski-Wende J.; Manson J.; Kuller L.; Hayden K.; Reiner AP.,"Recent studies suggest that both sex-specific genetic risk factors and those shared between dementia and stroke are involved in dementia pathogenesis. We performed both single-variant and gene-based genome-wide association studies of >11,000 whole genome sequences from the Women's Health Initiative cohort to discover loci associated with dementia, with adjustment for age, ethnicity, stroke, and venous thromboembolism status. Evidence for prior evidence of association and differential gene expression in dementia-related tissues and samples was gathered for each locus. Our multiethnic studies identified significant associations between variants within APOE, MYH11, FZD3, SORCS3, and GOLGA8B and risk of dementia. Ten genes implicated by these loci, including MYH11, FZD3, SORCS3, and GOLGA8B, were differentially expressed in the context of Alzheimer's disease. Our association of MYH11, FZD3, SORCS3, and GOLGA8B with dementia is supported by independent functional studies in human subjects, model systems, and associations with shared risk factors for stroke and dementia.",2021,02,Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association,17,2,215-225,,10.1002/alz.12181,32966694,#1633,Blue 2021,Exclusion reason: Wrong study design; ,""
A locus at 19q13.31 significantly reduces the ApoE ε4 risk for Alzheimer's Disease in African Ancestry.,Rajabli F.; Beecham GW.; Hendrie HC.; Baiyewu O.; Ogunniyi A.; Gao S.; Kushch NA.; Lipkin-Vasquez M.; Hamilton-Nelson KL.; Young JI.; Dykxhoorn DM.; Nuytemans K.; Kunkle BW.; Wang L.; Jin F.; Liu X.; Feliciano-Astacio BE.;  .; Schellenberg GD.; Dalgard CL.; Griswold AJ.; Byrd GS.; Reitz C.; Cuccaro ML.; Haines JL.; Pericak-Vance MA.; Vance JM.,"African descent populations have a lower Alzheimer disease risk from ApoE ε4 compared to other populations. Ancestry analysis showed that the difference in risk between African and European populations lies in the ancestral genomic background surrounding the ApoE locus (local ancestry). Identifying the mechanism(s) of this protection could lead to greater insight into the etiology of Alzheimer disease and more personalized therapeutic intervention. Our objective is to follow up the local ancestry finding and identify the genetic variants that drive this risk difference and result in a lower risk for developing Alzheimer disease in African ancestry populations. We performed association analyses using a logistic regression model with the ApoE ε4 allele as an interaction term and adjusted for genome-wide ancestry, age, and sex. Discovery analysis included imputed SNP data of 1,850 Alzheimer disease and 4,331 cognitively intact African American individuals. We performed replication analyses on 63 whole genome sequenced Alzheimer disease and 648 cognitively intact Ibadan individuals. Additionally, we reproduced results using whole-genome sequencing of 273 Alzheimer disease and 275 cognitively intact admixed Puerto Rican individuals. A further comparison was done with SNP imputation from an additional 8,463 Alzheimer disease and 11,365 cognitively intact non-Hispanic White individuals. We identified a significant interaction between the ApoE ε4 allele and the SNP rs10423769_A allele, (β = -0.54,SE = 0.12,p-value = 7.50x10-6) in the discovery data set, and replicated this finding in Ibadan (β = -1.32,SE = 0.52,p-value = 1.15x10-2) and Puerto Rican (β = -1.27,SE = 0.64,p-value = 4.91x10-2) individuals. The non-Hispanic Whites analyses showed an interaction trending in the ""protective"" direction but failing to pass a 0.05 significance threshold (β = -1.51,SE = 0.84,p-value = 7.26x10-2). The presence of the rs10423769_A allele reduces the odds ratio for Alzheimer disease risk from 7.2 for ApoE ε4/ε4 carriers lacking the A allele to 2.1 for ApoE ε4/ε4 carriers with at least one A allele. This locus is located approximately 2 mB upstream of the ApoE locus, in a large cluster of pregnancy specific beta-1 glycoproteins on chromosome 19 and lies within a long noncoding RNA, ENSG00000282943. This study identified a new African-ancestry specific locus that reduces the risk effect of ApoE ε4 for developing Alzheimer disease. The mechanism of the interaction with ApoEε4 is not known but suggests a novel mechanism for reducing the risk for ε4 carriers opening the possibility for potential ancestry-specific therapeutic intervention.",2022,07,PLoS genetics,18,7,e1009977,,10.1371/journal.pgen.1009977,35788729,#1605,Rajabli 2022,Exclusion reason: Wrong study design; ,""
Mutations modifying sporadic Alzheimer's disease age of onset.,Vélez JI.; Lopera F.; Patel HR.; Johar AS.; Cai Y.; Rivera D.; Tobón C.; Villegas A.; Sepulveda-Falla D.; Lehmann SG.; Easteal S.; Mastronardi CA.; Arcos-Burgos M.,"The identification of mutations modifying the age of onset (AOO) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial for understanding the natural history of AD and, therefore, for early interventions. Patients with sporadic AD (sAD) from a genetic isolate in the extremes of the AOO distribution were whole-exome genotyped. Single- and multi-locus linear mixed-effects models were used to identify functional variants modifying AOO. A posteriori enrichment and bioinformatic analyses were applied to evaluate the non-random clustering of the associate variants to physiopathological pathways involved in AD. We identified more than 20 pathogenic, genome-wide statistically significant mutations of major modifier effect on the AOO. These variants are harbored in genes implicated in neuron apoptosis, neurogenesis, inflammatory processes linked to AD, oligodendrocyte differentiation, and memory processes. This set of new genes harboring these mutations could be of importance for prediction, follow-up and eventually as therapeutical targets of AD. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2016,12,"American journal of medical genetics.

Family-based genome scan for age at onset of late-onset Alzheimer's disease in whole exome sequencing data.,Saad M.; Brkanac Z.; Wijsman EM.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common and complex neurodegenerative disease. Age at onset (AAO) of AD is an important component phenotype with a genetic basis, and identification of genes in which variation affects AAO would contribute to identification of factors that affect timing of onset. Increase in AAO through prevention or therapeutic measures would have enormous benefits by delaying AD and its associated morbidities. In this paper, we performed a family-based genome-wide association study for AAO of late-onset AD in whole exome sequence data generated in multigenerational families with multiple AD cases. We conducted single marker and gene-based burden tests for common and rare variants, respectively. We combined association analyses with variance component linkage analysis, and with reference to prior studies, in order to enhance evidence of the identified genes. For variants and genes implicated by the association study, we performed a gene-set enrichment analysis to identify potential novel pathways associated with AAO of AD. We found statistically significant association with AAO for three genes (WRN, NTN4 and LAMC3) with common associated variants, and for four genes (SLC8A3, SLC19A3, MADD and LRRK2) with multiple rare-associated variants that have a plausible biological function related to AD. The genes we have identified are in pathways that are strong candidates for involvement in the development of AD pathology and may lead to a better understanding of AD pathogenesis.",2015,Nov,"Genes, brain, and behavior",14,8,607-17,,10.1111/gbb.12250,26394601,#1503,Saad 2015,"Exclusion reason: Wrong study design; Edoardo Marcora (2020-12-03 05:36:02)(Excluded): Sample size <1,000; ",""
Identification of genetic risk factors in the Chinese population implicates a role of immune system in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.,Zhou X.; Chen Y.; Mok KY.; Zhao Q.; Chen K.; Chen Y.; Hardy J.; Li Y.; Fu AKY.; Guo Q.; Ip NY.;  .,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of mortality among the elderly. We performed a whole-genome sequencing study of AD in the Chinese population. In addition to the variants identified in or around the APOE locus (sentinel variant rs73052335, P = 1.44 × 10-14), two common variants, GCH1 (rs72713460, P = 4.36 × 10-5) and KCNJ15 (rs928771, P = 3.60 × 10-6), were identified and further verified for their possible risk effects for AD in three small non-Asian AD cohorts. Genotype-phenotype analysis showed that KCNJ15 variant rs928771 affects the onset age of AD, with earlier disease onset in minor allele carriers. In addition, altered expression level of the KCNJ15 transcript can be observed in the blood of AD subjects. Moreover, the risk variants of GCH1 and KCNJ15 are associated with changes in their transcript levels in specific tissues, as well as changes of plasma biomarkers levels in AD subjects. Importantly, network analysis of hippocampus and blood transcriptome datasets suggests that the risk variants in the APOE, GCH1, and KCNJ15 loci might exert their functions through their regulatory effects on immune-related pathways. Taking these data together, we identified common variants of GCH1 and KCNJ15 in the Chinese population that contribute to AD risk. These variants may exert their functional effects through the immune system.",2018,02,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,115,8,1697-1706,,10.1073/pnas.1715554115,29432188,#1526,Zhou 2018,"Exclusion reason: Wrong study design; Edoardo Marcora (2020-12-03 05:38:04)(Excluded): If the GWAS is performed on less than 1,000 subjects then it doesn't fit our study design inclusion criteria.; Elizabeth Blue (2020-10-16 08:48:48)(Select): This is tricky.

Association of Rare Coding Mutations With Alzheimer Disease and Other Dementias Among Adults of European Ancestry.,Patel D.; Mez J.; Vardarajan BN.; Staley L.; Chung J.; Zhang X.; Farrell JJ.; Rynkiewicz MJ.; Cannon-Albright LA.; Teerlink CC.; Stevens J.; Corcoran C.; Gonzalez Murcia JD.; Lopez OL.; Mayeux R.; Haines JL.; Pericak-Vance MA.; Schellenberg G.; Kauwe JSK.; Lunetta KL.; Farrer LA.;  .,"Some of the unexplained heritability of Alzheimer disease (AD) may be due to rare variants whose effects are not captured in genome-wide association studies because very large samples are needed to observe statistically significant associations. To identify genetic variants associated with AD risk using a nonstatistical approach. Genetic association study in which rare variants were identified by whole-exome sequencing in unrelated individuals of European ancestry from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP). Data were analyzed between March 2017 and September 2018. Minor alleles genome-wide and in 95 genes previously associated with AD, AD-related traits, or other dementias were tabulated and filtered for predicted functional impact and occurrence in participants with AD but not controls. Support for several findings was sought in a whole-exome sequencing data set comprising 19 affected relative pairs from Utah high-risk pedigrees and whole-genome sequencing data sets from the ADSP and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Among 5617 participants with AD (3202 [57.0%] women; mean [SD] age, 76.4 [9.3] years) and 4594 controls (2719 [59.0%] women; mean [SD] age, 86.5 [4.5] years), a total of 24 variants with moderate or high functional impact from 19 genes were observed in 10 or more participants with AD but not in controls. These variants included a missense mutation (rs149307620 [p.A284T], n = 10) in NOTCH3, a gene in which coding mutations are associated with cerebral autosomal-dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), that was also identified in 1 participant with AD and 1 participant with mild cognitive impairment in the whole genome sequencing data sets. Four participants with AD carried the TREM2 rs104894002 (p.Q33X) high-impact mutation that, in homozygous form, causes Nasu-Hakola disease, a rare disorder characterized by early-onset dementia and multifocal bone cysts, suggesting an intermediate inheritance model for the mutation. Compared with controls, participants with AD had a significantly higher burden of deleterious rare coding variants in dementia-associated genes (2314 vs 3354 cumulative variants, respectively; P = .006). Different mutations in the same gene or variable dose of a mutation may be associated with result in distinct dementias. These findings suggest that minor differences in the structure or amount of protein may be associated with in different clinical outcomes.
