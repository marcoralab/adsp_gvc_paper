Whole-genome sequencing reveals new Alzheimer's disease-associated rare variants in loci related to synaptic function and neuronal development.,Prokopenko D.; Morgan SL.; Mullin K.; Hofmann O.; Chapman B.; Kirchner R.; Amberkar S.; Wohlers I.; Lange C.; Hide W.; Bertram L.; Tanzi RE.,"Genome-wide association studies have led to numerous genetic loci associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) now permit genome-wide analyses to identify rare variants contributing to AD risk. We performed single-variant and spatial clustering-based testing on rare variants (minor allele frequency ≤1%) in a family-based WGS-based association study of 2,247 subjects from 605 multiplex AD families, followed by replication in 1,669 unrelated individuals. We identified 13 new AD candidate loci that yielded consistent rare-variant signals in discovery and replication cohorts (4 from single-variant, 9 from spatial-clustering), implicating these genes: FNBP1L, SEL1L, LINC00298, PRKCH, C15ORF41, C2CD3, KIF2A, APC, LHX9, NALCN, CTNNA2, SYTL3, CLSTN2. Downstream analyses of these novel loci highlight synaptic function, in contrast to common AD-associated variants, which implicate innate immunity. These loci have not been previously associated with AD, emphasizing the ability of WGS to identify AD-associated rare variants, particularly outside of coding regions.",2020,Nov,medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,,,,,10.1101/2020.11.03.20225540,33173892,#1630,Prokopenko 2020,"",""
"Rare variants in the endocytic pathway are associated with Alzheimer's disease, its related phenotypes, and functional consequences.",Zhan L.; Li J.; Jew B.; Sul JH.,"Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is the most common type of dementia causing irreversible brain damage to the elderly and presents a major public health challenge. Clinical research and genome-wide association studies have suggested a potential contribution of the endocytic pathway to AD, with an emphasis on common loci. However, the contribution of rare variants in this pathway to AD has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we focused on the effect of rare variants on AD by first applying a rare-variant gene-set burden analysis using genes in the endocytic pathway on over 3,000 individuals with European ancestry from three large whole-genome sequencing (WGS) studies. We identified significant associations of rare-variant burden within the endocytic pathway with AD, which were successfully replicated in independent datasets. We further demonstrated that this endocytic rare-variant enrichment is associated with neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and age-related phenotypes, increasing the risk of obtaining severer brain damage, earlier age-at-onset, and earlier age-of-death. Next, by aggregating rare variants within each gene, we sought to identify single endocytic genes associated with AD and NFTs. Careful examination using NFTs revealed one significantly associated gene, ANKRD13D. To identify functional associations, we integrated bulk RNA-Seq data from over 600 brain tissues and found two endocytic expression genes (eGenes), HLA-A and SLC26A7, that displayed significant influences on their gene expressions. Differential expressions between AD patients and controls of these three identified genes were further examined by incorporating scRNA-Seq data from 48 post-mortem brain samples and demonstrated distinct expression patterns across cell types. Taken together, our results demonstrated strong rare-variant effect in the endocytic pathway on AD risk and progression and functional effect of gene expression alteration in both bulk and single-cell resolution, which may bring more insight and serve as valuable resources for future AD genetic studies, clinical research, and therapeutic targeting.",2021,09,PLoS genetics,17,9,e1009772,,10.1371/journal.pgen.1009772,34516545,#1617,Zhan 2021,"",""
Hippocampal transcriptome-wide association study and neurobiological pathway analysis for Alzheimer's disease.,Liu N.; Xu J.; Liu H.; Zhang S.; Li M.; Zhou Y.; Qin W.; Li MJ.; Yu C.;  .,"Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified multiple susceptibility loci for Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is characterized by early and progressive damage to the hippocampus. However, the association of hippocampal gene expression with AD and the underlying neurobiological pathways remain largely unknown. Based on the genomic and transcriptomic data of 111 hippocampal samples and the summary data of two large-scale meta-analyses of GWASs, a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) was performed to identify genes with significant associations between hippocampal expression and AD. We identified 54 significantly associated genes using an AD-GWAS meta-analysis of 455,258 individuals; 36 of the genes were confirmed in another AD-GWAS meta-analysis of 63,926 individuals. Fine-mapping models further prioritized 24 AD-related genes whose effects on AD were mediated by hippocampal expression, including APOE and two novel genes (PTPN9 and PCDHA4). These genes are functionally related to amyloid-beta formation, phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, neuronal apoptosis, neurogenesis and telomerase-related processes. By integrating the predicted hippocampal expression and neuroimaging data, we found that the hippocampal expression of QPCTL and ERCC2 showed significant difference between AD patients and cognitively normal elderly individuals as well as correlated with hippocampal volume. Mediation analysis further demonstrated that hippocampal volume mediated the effect of hippocampal gene expression (QPCTL and ERCC2) on AD. This study identifies two novel genes associated with AD by integrating hippocampal gene expression and genome-wide association data and reveals candidate hippocampus-mediated neurobiological pathways from gene expression to AD.",2021,02,PLoS genetics,17,2,e1009363,,10.1371/journal.pgen.1009363,33630843,#1626,Liu 2021,"",""
Genome-wide association study of Alzheimer's disease CSF biomarkers in the EMIF-AD Multimodal Biomarker Discovery dataset.,Hong S.; Prokopenko D.; Dobricic V.; Kilpert F.; Bos I.; Vos SJB.; Tijms BM.; Andreasson U.; Blennow K.; Vandenberghe R.; Cleynen I.; Gabel S.; Schaeverbeke J.; Scheltens P.; Teunissen CE.; Niemantsverdriet E.; Engelborghs S.; Frisoni G.; Blin O.; Richardson JC.; Bordet R.; Molinuevo JL.; Rami L.;  .; Kettunen P.; Wallin A.; Lleó A.; Sala I.; Popp J.; Peyratout G.; Martinez-Lage P.; Tainta M.; Dobson RJB.; Legido-Quigley C.; Sleegers K.; Van Broeckhoven C.; Ten Kate M.; Barkhof F.; Zetterberg H.; Lovestone S.; Streffer J.; Wittig M.; Franke A.; Tanzi RE.; Visser PJ.; Bertram L.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder and the most common form of dementia in the elderly. Susceptibility to AD is considerably determined by genetic factors which hitherto were primarily identified using case-control designs. Elucidating the genetic architecture of additional AD-related phenotypic traits, ideally those linked to the underlying disease process, holds great promise in gaining deeper insights into the genetic basis of AD and in developing better clinical prediction models. To this end, we generated genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping data in 931 participants of the European Medical Information Framework Alzheimer's Disease Multimodal Biomarker Discovery (EMIF-AD MBD) sample to search for novel genetic determinants of AD biomarker variability. Specifically, we performed genome-wide association study (GWAS) analyses on 16 traits, including 14 measures derived from quantifications of five separate amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau-protein species in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In addition to confirming the well-established effects of apolipoprotein E (APOE) on diagnostic outcome and phenotypes related to Aβ42, we detected novel potential signals in the zinc finger homeobox 3 (ZFHX3) for CSF-Aβ38 and CSF-Aβ40 levels, and confirmed the previously described sex-specific association between SNPs in geminin coiled-coil domain containing (GMNC) and CSF-tau. Utilizing the results from independent case-control AD GWAS to construct polygenic risk scores (PRS) revealed that AD risk variants only explain a small fraction of CSF biomarker variability. In conclusion, our study represents a detailed first account of GWAS analyses on CSF-Aβ and -tau-related traits in the EMIF-AD MBD dataset. In subsequent work, we will utilize the genomics data generated here in GWAS of other AD-relevant clinical outcomes ascertained in this unique dataset.",2020,11,Translational psychiatry,10,1,403,,10.1038/s41398-020-01074-z,33223526,#1574,Hong 2020,"",""
Multi-trait association studies discover pleiotropic loci between Alzheimer's disease and cardiometabolic traits.,Bone WP.; Siewert KM.; Jha A.; Klarin D.; Damrauer SM.;  .; Chang KM.; Tsao PS.; Assimes TL.; Ritchie MD.; Voight BF.,"Identification of genetic risk factors that are shared between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other traits, i.e., pleiotropy, can help improve our understanding of the etiology of AD and potentially detect new therapeutic targets. Previous epidemiological correlations observed between cardiometabolic traits and AD led us to assess the pleiotropy between these traits. We performed a set of bivariate genome-wide association studies coupled with colocalization analysis to identify loci that are shared between AD and eleven cardiometabolic traits. For each of these loci, we performed colocalization with Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) to identify candidate causal genes. We identified three previously unreported pleiotropic trait associations at known AD loci as well as four novel pleiotropic loci. One associated locus was tagged by a low-frequency coding variant in the gene DOCK4 and is potentially implicated in its alternative splicing. Colocalization with GTEx eQTL data identified additional candidate genes for the loci we detected, including ACE, the target of the hypertensive drug class of ACE inhibitors. We found that the allele associated with decreased ACE expression in brain tissue was also associated with increased risk of AD, providing human genetic evidence of a potential increase in AD risk from use of an established anti-hypertensive therapeutic. Our results support a complex genetic relationship between AD and these cardiometabolic traits, and the candidate causal genes identified suggest that blood pressure and immune response play a role in the pleiotropy between these traits.",2021,02,Alzheimer's research & therapy,13,1,34,,10.1186/s13195-021-00773-z,33541420,#1573,Bone 2021,"",""

Recent Consanguinity and Outbred Autozygosity Are Associated With Increased Risk of Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease.,Napolioni V.; Scelsi MA.; Khan RR.; Altmann A.; Greicius MD.,"Prior work in late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) has resulted in discrepant findings as to whether recent consanguinity and outbred autozygosity are associated with LOAD risk. In the current study, we tested the association between consanguinity and outbred autozygosity with LOAD in the largest such analysis to date, in which 20 LOAD GWAS datasets were retrieved through public databases. Our analyses were restricted to eight distinct ethnic groups: African-Caribbean, Ashkenazi-Jewish European, European-Caribbean, French-Canadian, Finnish European, North-Western European, South-Eastern European, and Yoruba African for a total of 21,492 unrelated subjects (11,196 LOAD and 10,296 controls). Recent consanguinity determination was performed using FSuite v1.0.3, according to subjects' ancestral background. The level of autozygosity in the outbred population was assessed by calculating inbreeding estimates based on the proportion (FROH) and the number (NROH) of runs of homozygosity (ROHs). We analyzed all eight ethnic groups using a fixed-effect meta-analysis, which showed a significant association of recent consanguinity with LOAD (N = 21,481; OR = 1.262, P = 3.6 × 10-4), independently of APOE ∗4 (N = 21,468, OR = 1.237, P = 0.002), and years of education (N = 9,257; OR = 1.274, P = 0.020). Autozygosity in the outbred population was also associated with an increased risk of LOAD, both for F ROH (N = 20,237; OR = 1.204, P = 0.030) and N ROH metrics (N = 20,237; OR = 1.019, P = 0.006), independently of APOE ∗4 [(F ROH, N = 20,225; OR = 1.222, P = 0.029) (N ROH, N = 20,225; OR = 1.019, P = 0.007)]. By leveraging the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) whole-exome sequencing (WES) data, we determined that LOAD subjects do not show an enrichment of rare, risk-enhancing minor homozygote variants compared to the control population. A two-stage recessive GWAS using ADSP data from 201 consanguineous subjects in the discovery phase followed by validation in 10,469 subjects led to the identification of RPH3AL p.A303V (rs117190076) as a rare minor homozygote variant increasing the risk of LOAD [discovery: Genotype Relative Risk (GRR) = 46, P = 2.16 × 10-6; validation: GRR = 1.9, P = 8.0 × 10-4]. These results confirm that recent consanguinity and autozygosity in the outbred population increase risk for LOAD. Subsequent work, with increased samples sizes of consanguineous subjects, should accelerate the discovery of non-additive genetic effects in LOAD.",2020,,Frontiers in genetics,11,,629373,,10.3389/fgene.2020.629373,33584820,#1628,Napolioni 2020,"",""
Longitudinal data in peripheral blood confirm that PM20D1 is a quantitative trait locus (QTL) for Alzheimer's disease and implicate its dynamic role in disease progression.,Wang Q.; Chen Y.; Readhead B.; Chen K.; Su Y.; Reiman EM.; Dudley JT.,"While Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains one of the most challenging diseases to tackle, genome-wide genetic/epigenetic studies reveal many disease-associated risk loci, which sheds new light onto disease heritability, provides novel insights to understand its underlying mechanism and potentially offers easily measurable biomarkers for early diagnosis and intervention. We analyzed whole-genome DNA methylation data collected from peripheral blood in a cohort (n = 649) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and compared the DNA methylation level at baseline among participants diagnosed with AD (n = 87), mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n = 175) and normal controls (n = 162), to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs). We also leveraged up to 4 years of longitudinal DNA methylation data, sampled at approximately 1 year intervals to model alterations in methylation levels at DMRs to delineate methylation changes associated with aging and disease progression, by linear mixed-effects (LME) modeling for the unchanged diagnosis groups (AD, MCI and control, respectively) and U-shape testing for those with changed diagnosis (converters). When compared with controls, patients with MCI consistently displayed promoter hypomethylation at methylation QTL (mQTL) gene locus PM20D1. This promoter hypomethylation was even more prominent in patients with mild to moderate AD. This is in stark contrast with previously reported hypermethylation in hippocampal and frontal cortex brain tissues in patients with advanced-stage AD at this locus. From longitudinal data, we show that initial promoter hypomethylation of PM20D1 during MCI and early stage AD is reversed to eventual promoter hypermethylation in late stage AD, which helps to complete a fuller picture of methylation dynamics. We also confirm this observation in an independent cohort from the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) Study using DNA methylation and gene expression data from brain tissues as neuropathological staging (Braak score) advances. Our results confirm that PM20D1 is an mQTL in AD and demonstrate that it plays a dynamic role at different stages of the disease. Further in-depth study is thus warranted to fully decipher its role in the evolution of AD and potentially explore its utility as a blood-based biomarker for AD.",2020,12,Clinical epigenetics,12,1,189,,10.1186/s13148-020-00984-5,33298155,#1629,Wang 2020,"",""

A polygenic risk score predicts mosaic loss of chromosome Y in circulating blood cells.,Riaz M.; Mattisson J.; Polekhina G.; Bakshi A.; Halvardson J.; Danielsson M.; Ameur A.; McNeil J.; Forsberg LA.; Lacaze P.,"Mosaic loss of Y chromosome (LOY) is the most common somatic change that occurs in circulating white blood cells of older men. LOY in leukocytes is associated with increased risk for all-cause mortality and a range of common disease such as hematological and non-hematological cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and cardiovascular events. Recent genome-wide association studies identified up to 156 germline variants associated with risk of LOY. The objective of this study was to use these variants to calculate a novel polygenic risk score (PRS) for LOY, and to assess the predictive performance of this score in a large independent population of older men. We calculated a PRS for LOY in 5131 men aged 70 years and older. Levels of LOY were estimated using microarrays and validated by whole genome sequencing. After adjusting for covariates, the PRS was a significant predictor of LOY (odds ratio [OR] = 1.74 per standard deviation of the PRS, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.62-1.86, p < 0.001). Men in the highest quintile of the PRS distribution had > fivefold higher risk of LOY than the lowest (OR = 5.05, 95% CI 4.05-6.32, p < 0.001). Adding the PRS to a LOY prediction model comprised of age, smoking and alcohol consumption significantly improved prediction (AUC = 0.628 [CI 0.61-0.64] to 0.695 [CI 0.67-0.71], p < 0.001).

Manifestations of Alzheimer's disease genetic risk in the blood are evident in a multiomic analysis in healthy adults aged 18 to 90.,Heath L.; Earls JC.; Magis AT.; Kornilov SA.; Lovejoy JC.; Funk CC.; Rappaport N.; Logsdon BA.; Mangravite LM.; Kunkle BW.; Martin ER.; Naj AC.; Ertekin-Taner N.; Golde TE.; Hood L.; Price ND.;  .,"Genetics play an important role in late-onset Alzheimer's Disease (AD) etiology and dozens of genetic variants have been implicated in AD risk through large-scale GWAS meta-analyses. However, the precise mechanistic effects of most of these variants have yet to be determined. Deeply phenotyped cohort data can reveal physiological changes associated with genetic risk for AD across an age spectrum that may provide clues to the biology of the disease. We utilized over 2000 high-quality quantitative measurements obtained from blood of 2831 cognitively normal adult clients of a consumer-based scientific wellness company, each with CLIA-certified whole-genome sequencing data. Measurements included: clinical laboratory blood tests, targeted chip-based proteomics, and metabolomics. We performed a phenome-wide association study utilizing this diverse blood marker data and 25 known AD genetic variants and an AD-specific polygenic risk score (PGRS), adjusting for sex, age, vendor (for clinical labs), and the first four genetic principal components; sex-SNP interactions were also assessed. We observed statistically significant SNP-analyte associations for five genetic variants after correction for multiple testing (for SNPs in or near NYAP1, ABCA7, INPP5D, and APOE), with effects detectable from early adulthood. The ABCA7 SNP and the APOE2 and APOE4 encoding alleles were associated with lipid variability, as seen in previous studies; in addition, six novel proteins were associated with the e2 allele. The most statistically significant finding was between the NYAP1 variant and PILRA and PILRB protein levels, supporting previous functional genomic studies in the identification of a putative causal variant within the PILRA gene. We did not observe associations between the PGRS and any analyte. Sex modified the effects of four genetic variants, with multiple interrelated immune-modulating effects associated with the PICALM variant. In post-hoc analysis, sex-stratified GWAS results from an independent AD case-control meta-analysis supported sex-specific disease effects of the PICALM variant, highlighting the importance of sex as a biological variable. Known AD genetic variation influenced lipid metabolism and immune response systems in a population of non-AD individuals, with associations observed from early adulthood onward.

Sensitivity to gene dosage and gene expression affects genes with copy number variants observed among neuropsychiatric diseases.,Yamasaki M.; Makino T.; Khor SS.; Toyoda H.; Miyagawa T.; Liu X.; Kuwabara H.; Kano Y.; Shimada T.; Sugiyama T.; Nishida H.; Sugaya N.; Tochigi M.; Otowa T.; Okazaki Y.; Kaiya H.; Kawamura Y.; Miyashita A.; Kuwano R.; Kasai K.; Tanii H.; Sasaki T.; Honda M.; Tokunaga K.,"Copy number variants (CNVs) have been reported to be associated with diseases, traits, and evolution. However, it is hard to determine which gene should have priority as a target for further functional experiments if a CNV is rare or a singleton. In this study, we attempted to overcome this issue by using two approaches: by assessing the influences of gene dosage sensitivity and gene expression sensitivity. Dosage sensitive genes derived from two-round whole-genome duplication in previous studies. In addition, we proposed a cross-sectional omics approach that utilizes open data from GTEx to assess the effect of whole-genome CNVs on gene expression. Affymetrix Genome-Wide SNP Array 6.0 was used to detect CNVs by PennCNV and CNV Workshop. After quality controls for population stratification, family relationship and CNV detection, 287 patients with narcolepsy, 133 patients with essential hypersomnia, 380 patients with panic disorders, 164 patients with autism, 784 patients with Alzheimer disease and 1280 healthy individuals remained for the enrichment analysis. Overall, significant enrichment of dosage sensitive genes was found across patients with narcolepsy, panic disorders and autism. Particularly, significant enrichment of dosage-sensitive genes in duplications was observed across all diseases except for Alzheimer disease. For deletions, less or no enrichment of dosage-sensitive genes with deletions was seen in the patients when compared to the healthy individuals. Interestingly, significant enrichments of genes with expression sensitivity in brain were observed in patients with panic disorder and autism. While duplications presented a higher burden, deletions did not cause significant differences when compared to the healthy individuals. When we assess the effect of sensitivity to genome dosage and gene expression at the same time, the highest ratio of enrichment was observed in the group including dosage-sensitive genes and genes with expression sensitivity only in brain. In addition, shared CNV regions among the five neuropsychiatric diseases were also investigated.

Similar Genetic Architecture of Alzheimer's Disease and Differential APOE Effect Between Sexes.,Wang H.; Lo MT.; Rosenthal SB.; Makowski C.; Andreassen OA.; Salem RM.; McEvoy LK.; Fiecas M.; Chen CH.,"Sex differences have been observed in the clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and elucidating their genetic basis is an active research topic. Based on autosomal genotype data of 7,216 men and 10,680 women, including 8,136 AD cases and 9,760 controls, we explored sex-related genetic heterogeneity in AD by investigating SNP heritability, genetic correlation, as well as SNP- and gene-based genome-wide analyses. We found similar SNP heritability (men: 19.5%; women: 21.5%) and high genetic correlation (R g = 0.96) between the sexes. The heritability of APOE ε4-related risks for AD, after accounting for effects of all SNPs excluding chromosome 19, was nominally, but not significantly, higher in women (10.6%) than men (9.7%). In age-stratified analyses, ε3/ε4 was associated with a higher risk of AD among women than men aged 65-75 years, but not in the full sample. Apart from APOE, no new significant locus was identified in sex-stratified gene-based analyses. Our result of the high genetic correlation indicates overall similar genetic architecture of AD in both sexes at the genome-wide averaged level. Our study suggests that clinically observed sex differences may arise from sex-specific variants with small effects or more complicated mechanisms involving epigenetic alterations, sex chromosomes, or gene-environment interactions.",2021,,Frontiers in aging neuroscience,13,,674318,,10.3389/fnagi.2021.674318,34122051,#1567,Wang 2021,"",""
Alzheimer's disease genetic risk and sleep phenotypes in healthy young men: association with more slow waves and daytime sleepiness.,Muto V.; Koshmanova E.; Ghaemmaghami P.; Jaspar M.; Meyer C.; Elansary M.; Van Egroo M.; Chylinski D.; Berthomier C.; Brandewinder M.; Mouraux C.; Schmidt C.; Hammad G.; Coppieters W.; Ahariz N.; Degueldre C.; Luxen A.; Salmon E.; Phillips C.; Archer SN.; Yengo L.; Byrne E.; Collette F.; Georges M.; Dijk DJ.; Maquet P.; Visscher PM.; Vandewalle G.,"Sleep disturbances and genetic variants have been identified as risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our goal was to assess whether genome-wide polygenic risk scores (PRS) for AD associate with sleep phenotypes in young adults, decades before typical AD symptom onset. We computed whole-genome PRS for AD and extensively phenotyped sleep under different sleep conditions, including baseline sleep, recovery sleep following sleep deprivation, and extended sleep opportunity, in a carefully selected homogenous sample of 363 healthy young men (22.1 years ± 2.7) devoid of sleep and cognitive disorders. AD PRS was associated with more slow-wave energy, that is, the cumulated power in the 0.5-4 Hz EEG band, a marker of sleep need, during habitual sleep and following sleep loss, and potentially with larger slow-wave sleep rebound following sleep deprivation.

Careful feature selection is key in classification of Alzheimer's disease patients based on whole-genome sequencing data.,Osipowicz M.; Wilczynski B.; Machnicka MA.;  .,"Despite great increase of the amount of data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS), the genetic background of a partially heritable Alzheimer's disease (AD) is not fully understood yet. Machine learning methods are expected to help researchers in the analysis of the large number of SNPs possibly associated with the disease onset. To date, a number of such approaches were applied to genotype-based classification of AD patients and healthy controls using GWAS data and reported accuracy of 0.65-0.975. However, since the estimated influence of genotype on sporadic AD occurrence is lower than that, these very high classification accuracies may potentially be a result of overfitting. We have explored the possibilities of applying feature selection and classification using random forests to WGS and GWAS data from two datasets. Our results suggest that this approach is prone to overfitting if feature selection is performed before division of data into the training and testing set. Therefore, we recommend avoiding selection of features used to build the model based on data included in the testing set. We suggest that for currently available dataset sizes the expected classifier performance is between 0.55 and 0.7 (AUC) and higher accuracies reported in literature are likely a result of overfitting.",2021,Sep,NAR genomics and bioinformatics,3,3,lqab069,,10.1093/nargab/lqab069,34327330,#1618,Osipowicz 2021,"",""
An optimal kernel-based multivariate U-statistic to test for associations with multiple phenotypes.,Wen Y.; Lu Q.,"Set-based analysis that jointly considers multiple predictors in a group has been broadly conducted for association tests. However, their power can be sensitive to the distribution of phenotypes, and the underlying relationships between predictors and outcomes. Moreover, most of the set-based methods are designed for single-trait analysis, making it hard to explore the pleiotropic effect and borrow information when multiple phenotypes are available. Here, we propose a kernel-based multivariate U-statistics (KMU) that is robust and powerful in testing the association between a set of predictors and multiple outcomes. We employed a rank-based kernel function for the outcomes, which makes our method robust to various outcome distributions. Rather than selecting a single kernel, our test statistics is built based on multiple kernels selected in a data-driven manner, and thus is capable of capturing various complex relationships between predictors and outcomes. The asymptotic properties of our test statistics have been developed. Through simulations, we have demonstrated that KMU has controlled type I error and higher power than its counterparts. We further showed its practical utility by analyzing a whole genome sequencing data from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study, where novel genes have been detected to be associated with imaging phenotypes.",2022,07,"Biostatistics (Oxford, England)",23,3,705-720,,10.1093/biostatistics/kxaa049,33108446,#1631,Wen 2022,"",""
Aβ-accelerated neurodegeneration caused by Alzheimer's-associated ACE variant R1279Q is rescued by angiotensin system inhibition in mice.,Cuddy LK.; Prokopenko D.; Cunningham EP.; Brimberry R.; Song P.; Kirchner R.; Chapman BA.; Hofmann O.; Hide W.; Procissi D.; Hanania T.; Leiser SC.; Tanzi RE.; Vassar R.,"Recent genome-wide association studies identified the angiotensin-converting enzyme gene (ACE) as an Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk locus. However, the pathogenic mechanism by which ACE causes AD is unknown. Using whole-genome sequencing, we identified rare ACE coding variants in AD families and investigated one, ACE1 R1279Q, in knockin (KI) mice. Similar to AD, ACE1 was increased in neurons, but not microglia or astrocytes, of KI brains, which became elevated further with age. Angiotensin II (angII) and angII receptor AT1R signaling were also increased in KI brains. Autosomal dominant neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation occurred with aging in KI hippocampus, which were absent in the cortex and cerebellum. Female KI mice exhibited greater hippocampal electroencephalograph disruption and memory impairment compared to males. ACE variant effects were more pronounced in female KI mice, suggesting a mechanism for higher AD risk in women. Hippocampal neurodegeneration was completely rescued by treatment with brain-penetrant drugs that inhibit ACE1 and AT1R. Although ACE variant-induced neurodegeneration did not depend on β-amyloid (Aβ) pathology, amyloidosis in 5XFAD mice crossed to KI mice accelerated neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation, whereas Aβ deposition was unchanged. KI mice had normal blood pressure and cerebrovascular functions. Our findings strongly suggest that increased ACE1/angII signaling causes aging-dependent, Aβ-accelerated selective hippocampal neuron vulnerability and female susceptibility, hallmarks of AD that have hitherto been enigmatic. We conclude that repurposed brain-penetrant ACE inhibitors and AT1R blockers may protect against AD.",2020,09,Science translational medicine,12,563,,,10.1126/scitranslmed.aaz2541,32998969,#1632,Cuddy 2020,"",""

Network propagation of rare variants in Alzheimer's disease reveals tissue-specific hub genes and communities.,Scelsi MA.; Napolioni V.; Greicius MD.; Altmann A.;  .,"State-of-the-art rare variant association testing methods aggregate the contribution of rare variants in biologically relevant genomic regions to boost statistical power. However, testing single genes separately does not consider the complex interaction landscape of genes, nor the downstream effects of non-synonymous variants on protein structure and function.

We applied NETPAGE to sporadic, late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), using whole-genome sequencing from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort, as well as whole-exome sequencing from the AD Sequencing Project (ADSP). NETPAGE is based on network propagation, a framework that models information flow on a graph and simulates the percolation of genetic variation through tissue-specific gene interaction networks. The result of network propagation is a set of smoothed gene scores that can be tested for association with disease status through sparse regression. The application of NETPAGE to AD enabled the identification of a set of connected genes whose smoothed variation profile was robustly associated to case-control status, based on gene interactions in the hippocampus. Additionally, smoothed scores significantly correlated with risk of conversion to AD in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) subjects.

In a randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study (ReCognition) of piromelatine (5, 20, and 50 mg daily for 6 months) in participants with mild dementia due to AD (n=371, age 60-85 years), no statistically significant differences were found between the piromelatine and placebo-treated groups on the primary (i.e., computerized neuropsychological test battery (cNTB)) and secondary outcomes (ADCS-CGIC, ADCS-MCI-ADL, ADAS-cog14, NPI, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)) nor were there safety concerns (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02615002). This study was aimed at identifying genetic markers predicting piromelatine treatment response using a genome-wide association approach (GWAS). Variant genotyping of a combined whole genome and whole exome sequencing was performed using DNA extracted from lymphocytes from consenting participants. The general case-control allelic test was performed on piromelatine-treated participants, taking ""responders"" (i.e., >0.125 change from baseline in the cNTB) as cases and ""non responders"" as controls, using a Cochran-Armitage trend test. 58 outpatient clinics in the US. 371 participants were randomized in the trial; 107 provided informed consent for genotyping. The GWAS sample did not differ from the full study cohort in demographics, baseline characteristics, or response to piromelatine. Six single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in chromosome 2q12 (2:107,510,000-107,540,000) were associated with response (p-value < 1x10 -4 each).

Functional Studies of Genetic Variants Associated with Human Diseases in Notch Signaling-Related Genes Using Drosophila.,Yang SA.; Salazar JL.; Li-Kroeger D.; Yamamoto S.,"Rare variants in the many genes related to Notch signaling cause diverse Mendelian diseases that affect myriad organ systems. In addition, genome- and exome-wide association studies have linked common and rare variants in Notch-related genes to common diseases and phenotypic traits. Moreover, somatic mutations in these genes have been observed in many types of cancer, some of which are classified as oncogenic and others as tumor suppressive. While functional characterization of some of these variants has been performed through experimental studies, the number of ""variants of unknown significance"" identified in patients with diverse conditions keeps increasing as high-throughput sequencing technologies become more commonly used in the clinic. Furthermore, as disease gene discovery efforts identify rare variants in human genes that have yet to be linked to a disease, the demand for functional characterization of variants in these ""genes of unknown significance"" continues to increase. In this chapter, we describe a workflow to functionally characterize a rare variant in a Notch signaling related gene that was found to be associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease. This pipeline involves informatic analysis of the variant of interest using diverse human and model organism databases, followed by in vivo experiments in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. The protocol described here can be used to study variants that affect amino acids that are not conserved between human and fly. By ""humanizing"" the almondex gene in Drosophila with mutant alleles and heterologous genomic rescue constructs, a missense variant in TM2D3 (TM2 Domain Containing 3) was shown to be functionally damaging.

Use of Deep-Learning Genomics to Discriminate Healthy Individuals from Those with Alzheimer's Disease or Mild Cognitive Impairment.,Li L.; Yang Y.; Zhang Q.; Wang J.; Jiang J.; Neuroimaging Initiative AD.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder and the most common form of dementia in the elderly. Certain genes have been identified as important clinical risk factors for AD, and technological advances in genomic research, such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS), allow for analysis of polymorphisms and have been widely applied to studies of AD. However, shortcomings of GWAS include sensitivity to sample size and hereditary deletions, which result in low classification and predictive accuracy. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel deep-learning genomics approach and applies it to multitasking classification of AD progression, with the goal of identifying novel genetic biomarkers overlooked by traditional GWAS analysis. In this study, we selected genotype data from 1461 subjects enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, including 622 AD, 473 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 366 healthy control (HC) subjects. The proposed deep-learning genomics (DLG) approach consists of three steps: quality control, coding of single-nucleotide polymorphisms, and classification. The ResNet framework was used for the DLG model, and the results were compared with classifications by simple convolutional neural network structure. All data were randomly assigned to one training/validation group and one test group at a ratio of 9 : 1. And fivefold cross-validation was used. We compared classification results from the DLG model to those from traditional GWAS analysis among the three groups. For the AD and HC groups, the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of classification were, respectively, 98.78 ± 1.50%, 98.39% ± 2.50%, and 99.44% ± 1.11% using the DLG model, while 71.38% ± 0.63%, 63.13% ± 2.87%, and 85.59% ± 6.66% using traditional GWAS. Similar results were obtained from the other two intergroup classifications. The DLG model can achieve higher accuracy and sensitivity when applied to progression of AD. More importantly, we discovered several novel genetic biomarkers of AD progression, including rs6311 and rs6313 in HTR2A, rs1354269 in NAV2, and rs690705 in RFC3.

An L0 Regularization Method for Imaging Genetics and Whole Genome Association Analysis on Alzheimer's Disease.,Li X.; Lin Y.; Meng X.; Qiu Y.; Hu B.,"Although the neuroimaging measures build a bridge between genetic variants and disease phenotypes, an assessment of single nucleotide variants changes in brain structure and their clinically influence on the progression of Alzheimer's disease remain largely preliminary. Note that each variant has very weak correlation signal to neuroimaging measures or Alzheimer's disease phenotypes.

Pleiotropic predisposition to Alzheimer's disease and educational attainment: insights from the summary statistics analysis.,Kulminski AM.; Loiko E.; Loika Y.; Culminskaya I.,"Epidemiological studies report beneficial associations of higher educational attainment (EDU) with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Prior genome-wide association studies (GWAS) also reported variants associated with AD and EDU separately. The analysis of pleiotropic associations with these phenotypes may shed light on EDU-related protection against AD. We performed pleiotropic meta-analyses using Fisher's method and omnibus test applied to summary statistics for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with AD and EDU in large-scale univariate GWAS at suggestive-effect (5 × 10-8 < p < 0.1) and genome-wide (p ≤ 5 × 10-8) significance levels. We report 53 SNPs that attained p ≤ 5 × 10-8 at least in one of the pleiotropic meta-analyses and were reported in the univariate GWAS at 5 × 10-8 < p < 0.1. Of them, there were 46 pleiotropic SNPs according to Fisher's method. Additionally, Fisher's method identified 25 of 206 SNPs with pleiotropic effects, which attained p ≤ 5 × 10-8 in the univariate GWAS. We showed that a large fraction of the pleiotropic associations was affected by a counterintuitive phenomenon of antagonistic genetic heterogeneity, which explains the increase, rather than decrease, of the significance of the pleiotropic associations in the omnibus test. Functional enrichment analysis showed that apart from cancers, gene set harboring the non-pleiotropic SNPs was characterized by late-onset AD and neurodevelopmental disorders. The pleiotropic gene set was characterized by a broad spectrum of progressive neurological and neuromuscular diseases and immune-mediated conditions, including progressive motor neuropathy, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and severe AD.

Shared genetic etiology underlying late-onset Alzheimer's disease and posttraumatic stress syndrome.,Lutz MW.; Luo S.; Williamson DE.; Chiba-Falek O.,"Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) manifests comorbid neuropsychiatric symptoms and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with an increased risk for dementia in late life, suggesting the two disorders may share genetic etiologies.

Rare variant testing of imputed data: an analysis pipeline typified.,Drichel D.; Herold C.; Lacour A.; Ramirez A.; Jessen F.; Maier W.; Noethen MM.; Leber M.; Vaitsiakhovich T.; Becker T.,"Important methodological advancements in rare variant association testing have been made recently, among them collapsing tests, kernel methods and the variable threshold (VT) technique. Typically, rare variants from a region of interest are tested for association as a group ('bin'). Rare variant studies are already routinely performed as whole-exome sequencing studies. As an alternative approach, we propose a pipeline for rare variant analysis of imputed data and develop respective quality control criteria. We provide suggestions for the choice and construction of analysis bins in whole-genome application and support the analysis with implementations of standard burden tests (COLL, CMAT) in our INTERSNP-RARE software. In addition, three rare variant regression tests (REG, FRACREG and COLLREG) are implemented. All tests are accompanied with the VT approach which optimizes the definition of 'rareness'. We integrate kernel tests as implemented in SKAT/SKAT-O into the suggested strategies. Then, we apply our analysis scheme to a genome-wide association study of Alzheimer's disease. Further, we show that our pipeline leads to valid significance testing procedures with controlled type I error rates. Strong association signals surrounding the known APOE locus demonstrate statistical power. In addition, we highlight several suggestive rare variant association findings for follow-up studies, including genomic regions overlapping MCPH1, MED18 and NOTCH3. In summary, we describe and support a straightforward and cost-efficient rare variant analysis pipeline for imputed data and demonstrate its feasibility and validity. The strategy can complement rare variant studies with next generation sequencing data.",2014,,Human heredity,78,3-4,164-78,,10.1159/000368676,25504234,#1492,Drichel 2014,"",""

A Bayesian Framework for Generalized Linear Mixed Modeling Identifies New Candidate Loci for Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease.,Wang X.; Philip VM.; Ananda G.; White CC.; Malhotra A.; Michalski PJ.; Karuturi KRM.; Chintalapudi SR.; Acklin C.; Sasner M.; Bennett DA.; De Jager PL.; Howell GR.; Carter GW.,"Recent technical and methodological advances have greatly enhanced genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The advent of low-cost, whole-genome sequencing facilitates high-resolution variant identification, and the development of linear mixed models (LMM) allows improved identification of putatively causal variants. While essential for correcting false positive associations due to sample relatedness and population stratification, LMMs have commonly been restricted to quantitative variables. However, phenotypic traits in association studies are often categorical, coded as binary case-control or ordered variables describing disease stages. To address these issues, we have devised a method for genomic association studies that implements a generalized LMM (GLMM) in a Bayesian framework, called Bayes-GLMM Bayes-GLMM has four major features: (1) support of categorical, binary, and quantitative variables; (2) cohesive integration of previous GWAS results for related traits; (3) correction for sample relatedness by mixed modeling; and (4) model estimation by both Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling and maximal likelihood estimation. We applied Bayes-GLMM to the whole-genome sequencing cohort of the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project. This study contains 570 individuals from 111 families, each with Alzheimer's disease diagnosed at one of four confidence levels.

Low-frequency coding variants, not detected by GWAS, are predicted to include functional variants with larger effects on risk. To identify low-frequency coding variants with large effects on LOAD risk, we carried out whole-exome sequencing (WES) in 14 large LOAD families and follow-up analyses of the candidate variants in several large LOAD case-control data sets. A rare variant in PLD3 (phospholipase D3; Val232Met) segregated with disease status in two independent families and doubled risk for Alzheimer's disease in seven independent case-control series with a total of more than 11,000 cases and controls of European descent. Gene-based burden analyses in 4,387 cases and controls of European descent and 302 African American cases and controls, with complete sequence data for PLD3, reveal that several variants in this gene increase risk for Alzheimer's disease in both populations. PLD3 is highly expressed in brain regions that are vulnerable to Alzheimer's disease pathology, including hippocampus and cortex, and is expressed at significantly lower levels in neurons from Alzheimer's disease brains compared to control brains. Overexpression of PLD3 leads to a significant decrease in intracellular amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) and extracellular Aβ42 and Aβ40 (the 42- and 40-residue isoforms of the amyloid-β peptide), and knockdown of PLD3 leads to a significant increase in extracellular Aβ42 and Aβ40.

Quantitative phenotype scan statistic (QPSS) reveals rare variant associations with Alzheimer's disease endophenotypes.,Katsumata Y.; Fardo DW.,"Current sequencing technologies have provided for a more comprehensive genome-wide assessment and have increased genotyping accuracy of rare variants. Scan statistic approaches have previously been adapted to genetic sequencing data. Unlike currently-employed association tests, scan-statistic-based approaches can both localize clusters of disease-related variants and, subsequently, examine the phenotype association within the resulting cluster. In this study, we present a novel Quantitative Phenotype Scan Statistic (QPSS) that extends an approach for dichotomous phenotypes to continuous outcomes in order to identify genomic regions where rare quantitative-phenotype-associated variants cluster. We demonstrate the performance and practicality of QPSS with extensive simulations and an application to a whole-genome sequencing (WGS) study of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Using QPSS, we identify regions of rare variant enrichment associated with levels of AD-related proteins, CSF Aβ1-42 and p-tau181P. QPSS is implemented under the assumption that causal variants within a window have the same direction of effect.

The MUC6/AP2A2 Locus and Its Relevance to Alzheimer's Disease: A Review.,Nelson PT.; Fardo DW.; Katsumata Y.,"We recently reported evidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-linked genetic variation within the mucin 6 (MUC6) gene on chromosome 11p, nearby the adaptor-related protein complex 2 subunit alpha 2 (AP2A2) gene. This locus has interesting features related to human genomics and clinical research. MUC6 gene variants have been reported to potentially influence viral-including herpesvirus-immunity and the gut microbiome. Within the MUC6 gene is a unique variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) region. We discovered an association between MUC6 VNTR repeat expansion and AD pathologic severity, particularly tau proteinopathy. Here, we review the relevant literature. The AD-linked VNTR polymorphism may also influence AP2A2 gene expression. AP2A2 encodes a polypeptide component of the adaptor protein complex, AP-2, which is involved in clathrin-coated vesicle function and was previously implicated in AD pathogenesis. To provide background information, we describe some key knowledge gaps in AD genetics research. The ""missing/hidden heritability problem"" of AD is highlighted. Extensive portions of the human genome, including the MUC6 VNTR, have not been thoroughly evaluated due to limitations of existing high-throughput sequencing technology. We present and discuss additional data, along with cautionary considerations, relevant to the hypothesis that MUC6 repeat expansion influences AD pathogenesis.",2020,Jun,Journal of neuropathology and experimental neurology,79,6,568-584,,10.1093/jnen/nlaa024,32357373,#1555,Nelson 2020,"",""

One hundred forty-two measures of grey matter (GM) density, volume, and cortical thickness were extracted from baseline scans. GWAS, using PLINK, were performed on each phenotype using quality-controlled genotype and scan data including 530,992 of 620,903 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 733 of 818 participants (175 AD, 354 amnestic mild cognitive impairment, MCI, and 204 healthy controls, HC). Hierarchical clustering and heat maps were used to analyze the GWAS results and associations are reported at two significance thresholds (p<10(-7) and p<10(-6)). As expected, SNPs in the APOE and TOMM40 genes were confirmed as markers strongly associated with multiple brain regions. Other top SNPs were proximal to the EPHA4, TP63 and NXPH1 genes.

Multiple genes have been shown to contribute to the risk of Parkinson's disease, and currently 90 independent risk variants have been identified by genome-wide association studies. Thus far, a number of genes (including SNCA, LRRK2, and GBA) have been shown to contain variability across a spectrum of frequency and effect, from rare, highly penetrant variants to common risk alleles with small effect sizes. Variants in GBA, encoding the enzyme glucocerebrosidase, are associated with Lewy body diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia. These variants, which reduce or abolish enzymatic activity, confer a spectrum of disease risk, from 1.4- to >10-fold. An outstanding question in the field is what other genetic factors that influence GBA-associated risk for disease, and whether these overlap with known Parkinson's disease risk variants. Using multiple, large case-control datasets, totalling 217 165 individuals (22 757 Parkinson's disease cases, 13 431 Parkinson's disease proxy cases, 622 Lewy body dementia cases and 180 355 controls), we identified 1691 Parkinson's disease cases, 81 Lewy body dementia cases, 711 proxy cases and 7624 controls with a GBA variant (p.E326K, p.T369M or p.N370S). We performed a genome-wide association study and analysed the most recent Parkinson's disease-associated genetic risk score to detect genetic influences on GBA risk and age at onset. We attempted to replicate our findings in two independent datasets, including the personal genetics company 23andMe, Inc. and whole-genome sequencing data. Our analysis showed that the overall Parkinson's disease genetic risk score modifies risk for disease and decreases age at onset in carriers of GBA variants. Notably, this effect was consistent across all tested GBA risk variants. Dissecting this signal demonstrated that variants in close proximity to SNCA and CTSB (encoding cathepsin B) are the most significant contributors. Risk variants in the CTSB locus were identified to decrease mRNA expression of CTSB. Additional analyses suggest a possible genetic interaction between GBA and CTSB and GBA p.N370S induced pluripotent cell-derived neurons were shown to have decreased cathepsin B expression compared to controls. These data provide a genetic basis for modification of GBA-associated Parkinson's disease risk and age at onset, although the total contribution of common genetics variants is not large. We further demonstrate that common variability at genes implicated in lysosomal function exerts the largest effect on GBA associated risk for disease. Further, these results have implications for selection of GBA carriers for therapeutic interventions.",2020,01,Brain : a journal of neurology,143,1,234-248,,10.1093/brain/awz350,31755958,#1552,Blauwendraat 2020,"",""

After excluding imprinting, the data pinpoint 15,112 high-confidence ASM differentially methylated regions, of which 1838 contain SNPs in strong linkage disequilibrium or coinciding with GWAS peaks. ASM frequencies are increased in cancers versus matched normal tissues, due to widespread allele-specific hypomethylation and focal allele-specific hypermethylation in poised chromatin. Cancer cells show increased allele switching at ASM loci, but disruptive SNPs in specific classes of CTCF and transcription factor binding motifs are similarly correlated with ASM in cancer and non-cancer. Rare somatic mutations affecting these same motif classes track with de novo ASM.

Microglia - mediated immunity partly contributes to the genetic association between Alzheimer's disease and hippocampal volume.,Lancaster TM.; Hill MJ.; Sims R.; Williams J.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) suggest that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is partly explained by a burden of risk alleles (single nucleotide polymorphisms; SNPs) with relatively small effects. However, the mechanisms by which these loci cumulatively confer susceptibility remain largely unknown. Accumulating evidence suggests an association between increased AD risk allele burden (measured via a polygenic risk profile score; AD-RPS) with reduced hippocampal volume (HV) across a number of independent cohorts. These lines of research suggest that the reduced HV may be a causal mechanism of risk in the development of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, as RPS assesses broad, cumulative genetic risk, little is known about the biological processes which may explain this observation. Here, we leverage GWAS data from i) 17,008 late onset AD cases & 37,154 controls and ii) hippocampal volume (N = 12,147; N = 9707) to explore putative pathways that may explain this association.

Last, using a competitive, permutation based approach, we show that the common variation within this candidate gene-set is associated with HV, controlling for SNP set-size (P = 0.024).

FGWAS: Functional genome wide association analysis.,Huang C.; Thompson P.; Wang Y.; Yu Y.; Zhang J.; Kong D.; Colen RR.; Knickmeyer RC.; Zhu H.;  .,"Functional phenotypes (e.g., subcortical surface representation), which commonly arise in imaging genetic studies, have been used to detect putative genes for complexly inherited neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. However, existing statistical methods largely ignore the functional features (e.g., functional smoothness and correlation). The aim of this paper is to develop a functional genome-wide association analysis (FGWAS) framework to efficiently carry out whole-genome analyses of functional phenotypes. FGWAS consists of three components: a multivariate varying coefficient model, a global sure independence screening procedure, and a test procedure. Compared with the standard multivariate regression model, the multivariate varying coefficient model explicitly models the functional features of functional phenotypes through the integration of smooth coefficient functions and functional principal component analysis. Statistically, compared with existing methods for genome-wide association studies (GWAS), FGWAS can substantially boost the detection power for discovering important genetic variants influencing brain structure and function. Simulation studies show that FGWAS outperforms existing GWAS methods for searching sparse signals in an extremely large search space, while controlling for the family-wise error rate.

Therefore, we pursued genome sequencing of a related phenotype-healthy aging-to understand the genetics of disease-free aging without medical intervention. In contrast with studies of exceptional longevity, usually focused on centenarians, healthy aging is not associated with known longevity variants, but is associated with reduced genetic susceptibility to Alzheimer and coronary artery disease. Additionally, healthy aging is not associated with a decreased rate of rare pathogenic variants, potentially indicating the presence of disease-resistance factors. In keeping with this possibility, we identify suggestive common and rare variant genetic associations implying that protection against cognitive decline is a genetic component of healthy aging.

Targeted Sequencing of Alzheimer Disease Genes in African Americans Implicates Novel Risk Variants.,Logue MW.; Lancour D.; Farrell J.; Simkina I.; Fallin MD.; Lunetta KL.; Farrer LA.,"The genetic architecture of late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD) in African Americans (AAs) differs from that in persons of European ancestry. In addition to APOE, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of AD in AA samples have implicated ABCA7, COBL, and SLC10A2 as AA-AD risk genes. Previously, we identified by whole exome sequencing a small number of AA AD cases and subsequent genotyping in a large AA sample of AD cases and controls association of AD risk with a pair of rare missense variants in AKAP9. In this study, we performed targeted deep sequencing (including both introns and exons) of approximately 100 genes previously linked to AD or AD-related traits in an AA cohort of 489 AD cases and 472 controls to find novel AD risk variants. We observed association with an 11 base-pair frame-shift loss-of-function (LOF) variant in ABCA7 (rs567222111) for which the evidence was bolstered when combined with data from a replication AA cohort of 484 cases and 484 controls (OR = 2.42, p = 0.022).

Evidence of recessive Alzheimer disease loci in a Caribbean Hispanic data set: genome-wide survey of runs of homozygosity.,Ghani M.; Sato C.; Lee JH.; Reitz C.; Moreno D.; Mayeux R.; St George-Hyslop P.; Rogaeva E.,"IMPORTANCE The search for novel Alzheimer disease (AD) genes or pathologic mutations within known AD loci is ongoing. The development of array technologies has helped to identify rare recessive mutations among long runs of homozygosity (ROHs), in which both parental alleles are identical. Caribbean Hispanics are known to have an elevated risk for AD and tend to have large families with evidence of inbreeding. OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that the late-onset AD in a Caribbean Hispanic population might be explained in part by the homozygosity of unknown loci that could harbor recessive AD risk haplotypes or pathologic mutations. DESIGN We used genome-wide array data to identify ROHs (&gt;1 megabase) and conducted global burden and locus-specific ROH analyses. SETTING A whole-genome case-control ROH study. PARTICIPANTS A Caribbean Hispanic data set of 547 unrelated cases (48.8% with familial AD) and 542 controls collected from a population known to have a 3-fold higher risk of AD vs non-Hispanics in the same community. Based on a Structure program analysis, our data set consisted of African Hispanic (207 cases and 192 controls) and European Hispanic (329 cases and 326 controls) participants. EXPOSURE Alzheimer disease risk genes. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We calculated the total and mean lengths of the ROHs per sample. Global burden measurements among autosomal chromosomes were investigated in cases vs controls. Pools of overlapping ROH segments (consensus regions) were identified, and the case to control ratio was calculated for each consensus region. We formulated the tested hypothesis before data collection. RESULTS In total, we identified 17 137 autosomal regions with ROHs. The mean length of the ROH per person was significantly greater in cases vs controls (P = .0039), and this association was stronger with familial AD (P = .0005). Among the European Hispanics, a consensus region at the EXOC4 locus was significantly associated with AD even after correction for multiple testing (empirical P value 1 [EMP1], .0001; EMP2, .002; 21 AD cases vs 2 controls). Among the African Hispanic subset, the most significant but nominal association was observed for CTNNA3, a well-known AD gene candidate (EMP1, .002; 10 AD cases vs 0 controls). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Our results show that ROHs could significantly contribute to the etiology of AD. Future studies would require the analysis of larger, relatively inbred data sets that might reveal novel recessive AD genes.

On the association analysis of genome-sequencing data: A spatial clustering approach for partitioning the entire genome into nonoverlapping windows.,Loehlein Fier H.; Prokopenko D.; Hecker J.; Cho MH.; Silverman EK.; Weiss ST.; Tanzi RE.; Lange C.,"For the association analysis of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) studies, we propose an efficient and fast spatial-clustering algorithm. Compared to existing analysis approaches for WGS data, that define the tested regions either by sliding or consecutive windows of fixed sizes along variants, a meaningful grouping of nearby variants into consecutive regions has the advantage that, compared to sliding window approaches, the number of tested regions is likely to be smaller. In comparison to consecutive, fixed-window approaches, our approach is likely to group nearby variants together. Given existing biological evidence that disease-associated mutations tend to physically cluster in specific regions along the chromosome, the identification of meaningful groups of nearby located variants could thus lead to a potential power gain for association analysis. Our algorithm defines consecutive genomic regions based on the physical positions of the variants, assuming an inhomogeneous Poisson process and groups together nearby variants. As parameters are estimated locally, the algorithm takes the differing variant density along the chromosome into account and provides locally optimal partitioning of variants into consecutive regions. An R-implementation of the algorithm is provided. We discuss the theoretical advances of our algorithm compared to existing, window-based approaches and show the performance and advantage of our introduced algorithm in a simulation study and by an application to Alzheimer's disease WGS data. Our analysis identifies a region in the ITGB3 gene that potentially harbors disease susceptibility loci for Alzheimer's disease.

New Genome-Wide Methods for Elucidation of Candidate Copy Number Variations (CNVs) Contributing to Alzheimer's Disease Heritability.,Szigeti K.,"The complexity of human genetic variation has been extended by the observation of abundant and widespread variation in the copy number of submicroscopic DNA segments.

Mutations in CRADD Result in Reduced Caspase-2-Mediated Neuronal Apoptosis and Cause Megalencephaly with a Rare Lissencephaly Variant.,Di Donato N.; Jean YY.; Maga AM.; Krewson BD.; Shupp AB.; Avrutsky MI.; Roy A.; Collins S.; Olds C.; Willert RA.; Czaja AM.; Johnson R.; Stover JA.; Gottlieb S.; Bartholdi D.; Rauch A.; Goldstein A.; Boyd-Kyle V.; Aldinger KA.; Mirzaa GM.; Nissen A.; Brigatti KW.; Puffenberger EG.; Millen KJ.; Strauss KA.; Dobyns WB.; Troy CM.; Jinks RN.,"Lissencephaly is a malformation of cortical development typically caused by deficient neuronal migration resulting in cortical thickening and reduced gyration. Here we describe a ""thin"" lissencephaly (TLIS) variant characterized by megalencephaly, frontal predominant pachygyria, intellectual disability, and seizures. Trio-based whole-exome sequencing and targeted re-sequencing identified recessive mutations of CRADD in six individuals with TLIS from four unrelated families of diverse ethnic backgrounds. CRADD (also known as RAIDD) is a death-domain-containing adaptor protein that oligomerizes with PIDD and caspase-2 to initiate apoptosis. TLIS variants cluster in the CRADD death domain, a platform for interaction with other death-domain-containing proteins including PIDD. Although caspase-2 is expressed in the developing mammalian brain, little is known about its role in cortical development. CRADD/caspase-2 signaling is implicated in neurotrophic factor withdrawal- and amyloid-β-induced dendritic spine collapse and neuronal apoptosis, suggesting a role in cortical sculpting and plasticity. TLIS-associated CRADD variants do not disrupt interactions with caspase-2 or PIDD in co-immunoprecipitation assays, but still abolish CRADD's ability to activate caspase-2, resulting in reduced neuronal apoptosis in vitro. Homozygous Cradd knockout mice display megalencephaly and seizures without obvious defects in cortical lamination, supporting a role for CRADD/caspase-2 signaling in mammalian brain development. Megalencephaly and lissencephaly associated with defective programmed cell death from loss of CRADD function in humans implicate reduced apoptosis as an important pathophysiological mechanism of cortical malformation. Our data suggest that CRADD/caspase-2 signaling is critical for normal gyration of the developing human neocortex and for normal cognitive ability.",2016,Nov,American journal of human genetics,99,5,1117-1129,,10.1016/j.ajhg.2016.09.010,27773430,#1513,DiDonato 2016,"",""
Mild traumatic brain injury is associated with reduced cortical thickness in those at risk for Alzheimer's disease.,Hayes JP.; Logue MW.; Sadeh N.; Spielberg JM.; Verfaellie M.; Hayes SM.; Reagan A.; Salat DH.; Wolf EJ.; McGlinchey RE.; Milberg WP.; Stone A.; Schichman SA.; Miller MW.,"Moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury is one of the strongest environmental risk factors for the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as late-onset Alzheimer's disease, although it is unclear whether mild traumatic brain injury, or concussion, also confers risk. This study examined mild traumatic brain injury and genetic risk as predictors of reduced cortical thickness in brain regions previously associated with early Alzheimer's disease, and their relationship with episodic memory. Participants were 160 Iraq and Afghanistan War veterans between the ages of 19 and 58, many of whom carried mild traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder diagnoses. Whole-genome polygenic risk scores for the development of Alzheimer's disease were calculated using summary statistics from the largest Alzheimer's disease genome-wide association study to date. Results showed that mild traumatic brain injury moderated the relationship between genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease and cortical thickness, such that individuals with mild traumatic brain injury and high genetic risk showed reduced cortical thickness in Alzheimer's disease-vulnerable regions. Among males with mild traumatic brain injury, high genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease was associated with cortical thinning as a function of time since injury. A moderated mediation analysis showed that mild traumatic brain injury and high genetic risk indirectly influenced episodic memory performance through cortical thickness, suggesting that cortical thinning in Alzheimer's disease-vulnerable brain regions is a mechanism for reduced memory performance. Finally, analyses that examined the apolipoprotein E4 allele, post-traumatic stress disorder, and genetic risk for schizophrenia and depression confirmed the specificity of the Alzheimer's disease polygenic risk finding. These results provide evidence that mild traumatic brain injury is associated with greater neurodegeneration and reduced memory performance in individuals at genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease, with the caveat that the order of causal effects cannot be inferred from cross-sectional studies. These results underscore the importance of documenting head injuries even within the mild range as they may interact with genetic risk to produce negative long-term health consequences such as neurodegenerative disease.",2017,03,Brain : a journal of neurology,140,3,813-825,,10.1093/brain/aww344,28077398,#1514,Hayes 2017,"",""
Phosphodiesterase 4D Gene Modifies the Functional Network of Patients With Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease.,Xiang J.; Wang X.; Gao Y.; Li T.; Cao R.; Yan T.; Ma Y.; Niu Y.; Xue J.; Wang B.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is affected by several genetic variants. It has been demonstrated that genetic variants affect brain organization and function. In this study, using whole genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we analyzed the functional magnetic resonance imaging and genetic data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset (ADNI) dataset and identified genetic variants associated with the topology of the functional brain network http://www.adni-info.org. We found three novel loci (rs2409627, rs9647533, and rs11955845) in an intron of the phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) gene that contribute to abnormalities in the topological organization of the functional network. In particular, compared to the wild-type genotype, the subjects carrying the PDE4D variants had altered network properties, including a significantly reduced clustering coefficient, small-worldness, global and local efficiency, a significantly enhanced path length and a normalized path length. In addition, we found that all global brain network attributes were affected by PDE4D variants to different extents as the disease progressed. Additionally, brain regions with alterations in nodal efficiency due to the variations in PDE4D were predominant in the limbic lobe, temporal lobe and frontal lobes. PDE4D has a great effect on memory consolidation and cognition through long-term potentiation (LTP) effects and/or the promotion of inflammatory effects. PDE4D variants might be a main reasons underlyling for the abnormal topological properties and cognitive impairment. Furthermore, we speculated that PDE4D is a risk factor for neural degenerative diseases and provided important clues for the earlier detection and therapeutic intervention for AD.",2020,,Frontiers in genetics,11,,890,,10.3389/fgene.2020.00890,32849849,#1561,Xiang 2020,"",""
Transcriptomic stratification of late-onset Alzheimer's cases reveals novel genetic modifiers of disease pathology.,Milind N.; Preuss C.; Haber A.; Ananda G.; Mukherjee S.; John C.; Shapley S.; Logsdon BA.; Crane PK.; Carter GW.,"Late-Onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) is a common, complex genetic disorder well-known for its heterogeneous pathology. The genetic heterogeneity underlying common, complex diseases poses a major challenge for targeted therapies and the identification of novel disease-associated variants. Case-control approaches are often limited to examining a specific outcome in a group of heterogenous patients with different clinical characteristics. Here, we developed a novel approach to define relevant transcriptomic endophenotypes and stratify decedents based on molecular profiles in three independent human LOAD cohorts. By integrating post-mortem brain gene co-expression data from 2114 human samples with LOAD, we developed a novel quantitative, composite phenotype that can better account for the heterogeneity in genetic architecture underlying the disease. We used iterative weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to reduce data dimensionality and to isolate gene sets that are highly co-expressed within disease subtypes and represent specific molecular pathways. We then performed single variant association testing using whole genome-sequencing data for the novel composite phenotype in order to identify genetic loci that contribute to disease heterogeneity. Distinct LOAD subtypes were identified for all three study cohorts (two in ROSMAP, three in Mayo Clinic, and two in Mount Sinai Brain Bank). Single variant association analysis identified a genome-wide significant variant in TMEM106B (p-value < 5×10-8, rs1990620G) in the ROSMAP cohort that confers protection from the inflammatory LOAD subtype.

Haplotype analysis of APOE intragenic SNPs.,Babenko VN.; Afonnikov DA.; Ignatieva EV.; Klimov AV.; Gusev FE.; Rogaev EI.,"APOE ε4 allele is most common genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cognitive decline. However, it remains poorly understood why only some carriers of APOE ε4 develop AD and how ethnic variabilities in APOE locus contribute to AD risk. Here, to address the role of APOE haplotypes, we reassessed the diversity of APOE locus in major ethnic groups and in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset on patients with AD, and subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and control non-demented individuals. We performed APOE gene haplotype analysis for a short block of five SNPs across the gene using the ADNI whole genome sequencing dataset. The compilation of ADNI data with 1000 Genomes identified the APOE ε4 linked haplotypes, which appeared to be distant for the Asian, African and European populations. The common European ε4-bearing haplotype is associated with AD but not with MCI, and the Africans lack this haplotype. Haplotypic inference revealed alleles that may confer protection against AD. By assessing the DNA methylation profile of the APOE haplotypes, we found that the AD-associated haplotype features elevated APOE CpG content, implying that this locus can also be regulated by genetic-epigenetic interactions. We showed that SNP frequency profiles within APOE locus are highly skewed to population-specific haplotypes, suggesting that the ancestral background within different sites at APOE gene may shape the disease phenotype. We propose that our results can be utilized for more specific risk assessment based on population descent of the individuals and on higher specificity of five site haplotypes associated with AD.",2018,04,BMC neuroscience,19,Suppl 1,16,,10.1186/s12868-018-0413-4,29745836,#1532,Babenko 2018,"",""
A knowledge-based weighting framework to boost the power of genome-wide association studies.,Li MX.; Sham PC.; Cherny SS.; Song YQ.,"We are moving to second-wave analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), characterized by comprehensive bioinformatical and statistical evaluation of genetic associations. Existing biological knowledge is very valuable for GWAS, which may help improve their detection power particularly for disease susceptibility loci of moderate effect size. However, a challenging question is how to utilize available resources that are very heterogeneous to quantitatively evaluate the statistic significances. We present a novel knowledge-based weighting framework to boost power of the GWAS and insightfully strengthen their explorative performance for follow-up replication and deep sequencing. Built upon diverse integrated biological knowledge, this framework directly models both the prior functional information and the association significances emerging from GWAS to optimally highlight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for subsequent replication. In the theoretical calculation and computer simulation, it shows great potential to achieve extra over 15% power to identify an association signal of moderate strength or to use hundreds of whole-genome subjects fewer to approach similar power. In a case study on late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) for a proof of principle, it highlighted some genes, which showed positive association with LOAD in previous independent studies, and two important LOAD related pathways. These genes and pathways could be originally ignored due to involved SNPs only having moderate association significance. With user-friendly implementation in an open-source Java package, this powerful framework will provide an important complementary solution to identify more true susceptibility loci with modest or even small effect size in current GWAS for complex diseases.",2010,Dec,PloS one,5,12,e14480,,10.1371/journal.pone.0014480,21217833,#1478,Li 2010,"",""
Transcriptional Remodeling in Primary Hippocampal Astrocytes from an Alzheimer's Disease Mouse Model.,Ruffinatti F.; Tapella L.; Gregnanin I.; Stevano A.; Chiorino G.; Canonico PL.; Distasi C.; Genazzani AA.; Lim D.,"It is well known that alterations in astrocytes occur in Alzheimer's disease and reactive astrogliosis is one of the hallmarks of the disease.

The aim of present work was to characterize the transcriptional alterations occurring in cultured astrocytes from 3xTg-AD mouse pups compared to control non-transgenic mice. Furthermore, we also compared these changes to those reported by others in astrocytes from symptomatic AD mice. We conducted a whole-genome microarray study on primary cultured astrocytes from the hippocampus of 3xTg-AD and non-transgenic mouse newborn pups. We used cross-platform normalization and an unsupervised hierarchical clustering algorithm to compare our results with other datasets of cultured or freshly isolated astrocytes, including those isolated from plaque-stage APPswe/PS1dE9 AD mice. We found a set of 993 genes differentially expressed in 3xTg-AD as compared with non-Tg astrocytes. Over-represented gene ontology terms were related to calcium, cell-cell communication, mitochondria, transcription, nucleotide binding and phosphorylation. Of note, no genes related to inflammation were found in cultured 3xTg-AD astrocytes. Comparison with astrocytes isolated from plaque stage APPswe/PS1dE9 showed that 882 out of 993 genes were selectively changed in primary 3xTg-AD astrocytes while 50 genes were co-regulated and 61 were anti-regulated (regulated in the opposite direction in the datasets).

Using whole-genome sequencing we now identified a single rare nonsynonymous variant (SNV) rs142946965 [p.R215I] in ADAM17 co-segregating with an autosomal-dominant pattern of late-onset AD in one family. Subsequent genotyping and analysis of available whole-exome sequencing data of additional case/control samples from Germany, UK, and USA identified five variant carriers among AD patients only. The mutation inhibits pro-protein cleavage and the formation of the active enzyme, thus leading to loss-of-function of ADAM17 alpha-secretase. Further, we identified a strong negative correlation between ADAM17 and APP gene expression in human brain and present in vitro evidence that ADAM17 negatively controls the expression of APP.

Genetic analysis of cortical thickness and fractional anisotropy of water diffusion in the brain.,Kochunov P.; Glahn DC.; Nichols TE.; Winkler AM.; Hong EL.; Holcomb HH.; Stein JL.; Thompson PM.; Curran JE.; Carless MA.; Olvera RL.; Johnson MP.; Cole SA.; Kochunov V.; Kent J.; Blangero J.,"The thickness of the brain's cortical gray matter (GM) and the fractional anisotropy (FA) of the cerebral white matter (WM) each follow an inverted U-shape trajectory with age. The two measures are positively correlated and may be modulated by common biological mechanisms. We employed four types of genetic analyses to localize individual genes acting pleiotropically upon these phenotypes. Whole-brain and regional GM thickness and FA values were measured from high-resolution anatomical and diffusion tensor MR images collected from 712, Mexican American participants (438 females, age = 47.9 ± 13.2 years) recruited from 73 (9.7 ± 9.3 individuals/family) large families. The significance of the correlation between two traits was estimated using a bivariate genetic correlation analysis. Localization of chromosomal regions that jointly influenced both traits was performed using whole-genome quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis. Gene localization was performed using SNP genotyping on Illumina 1M chip and correlation with leukocyte-based gene-expression analyses. The gene-expressions were measured using the Illumina BeadChip. These data were available for 371 subjects. Significant genetic correlation was observed among GM thickness and FA values. Significant logarithm of odds (LOD ≥ 3.0) QTLs were localized within chromosome 15q22-23. More detailed localization reported no significant association (p < 5·10(-5)) for 1565 SNPs located within the QTLs. Post hoc analysis indicated that 40% of the potentially significant (p ≤ 10(-3)) SNPs were localized to the related orphan receptor alpha (RORA) and NARG2 genes. A potentially significant association was observed for the rs2456930 polymorphism reported as a significant GWAS finding in Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative subjects. The expression levels for RORA and ADAM10 genes were significantly (p < 0.05) correlated with both FA and GM thickness. NARG2 expressions were significantly correlated with GM thickness (p < 0.05) but failed to show a significant correlation (p = 0.09) with FA. This study identified a novel, significant QTL at 15q22-23. SNP correlation with gene-expression analyses indicated that RORA, NARG2, and ADAM10 jointly influence GM thickness and WM-FA values.",2011,,Frontiers in neuroscience,5,,120,,10.3389/fnins.2011.00120,22028680,#1481,Kochunov 2011,"",""
Identification of gene pathways implicated in Alzheimer's disease using longitudinal imaging phenotypes with sparse regression.,Silver M.; Janousova E.; Hua X.; Thompson PM.; Montana G.;  .,"We present a new method for the detection of gene pathways associated with a multivariate quantitative trait, and use it to identify causal pathways associated with an imaging endophenotype characteristic of longitudinal structural change in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our method, known as pathways sparse reduced-rank regression (PsRRR), uses group lasso penalised regression to jointly model the effects of genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), grouped into functional pathways using prior knowledge of gene-gene interactions. Pathways are ranked in order of importance using a resampling strategy that exploits finite sample variability. Our application study uses whole genome scans and MR images from 99 probable AD patients and 164 healthy elderly controls in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. 66,182 SNPs are mapped to 185 gene pathways from the KEGG pathway database. Voxel-wise imaging signatures characteristic of AD are obtained by analysing 3D patterns of structural change at 6, 12 and 24 months relative to baseline. High-ranking, AD endophenotype-associated pathways in our study include those describing insulin signalling, vascular smooth muscle contraction and focal adhesion. All of these have been previously implicated in AD biology. In a secondary analysis, we investigate SNPs and genes that may be driving pathway selection. High ranking genes include a number previously linked in gene expression studies to β-amyloid plaque formation in the AD brain (PIK3R3,PIK3CG,PRKCAandPRKCB), and to AD related changes in hippocampal gene expression (ADCY2, ACTN1, ACACA, and GNAI1).

Plasma aβ measures were linearly regressed onto age, gender, APOE ε4 carrier status, and time elapsed between visits (fold-changes only) separately by race.

Knowledge-driven binning approach for rare variant association analysis: application to neuroimaging biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease.,Kim D.; Basile AO.; Bang L.; Horgusluoglu E.; Lee S.; Ritchie MD.; Saykin AJ.; Nho K.,"Rapid advancement of next generation sequencing technologies such as whole genome sequencing (WGS) has facilitated the search for genetic factors that influence disease risk in the field of human genetics. To identify rare variants associated with human diseases or traits, an efficient genome-wide binning approach is needed. In this study we developed a novel biological knowledge-based binning approach for rare-variant association analysis and then applied the approach to structural neuroimaging endophenotypes related to late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). For rare-variant analysis, we used the knowledge-driven binning approach implemented in Bin-KAT, an automated tool, that provides 1) binning/collapsing methods for multi-level variant aggregation with a flexible, biologically informed binning strategy and 2) an option of performing unified collapsing and statistical rare variant analyses in one tool. A total of 750 non-Hispanic Caucasian participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort who had both WGS data and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were used in this study. Mean bilateral cortical thickness of the entorhinal cortex extracted from MRI scans was used as an AD-related neuroimaging endophenotype. SKAT was used for a genome-wide gene- and region-based association analysis of rare variants (MAF (minor allele frequency) < 0.05) and potential confounding factors (age, gender, years of education, intracranial volume (ICV) and MRI field strength) for entorhinal cortex thickness were used as covariates. Significant associations were determined using FDR adjustment for multiple comparisons. Our knowledge-driven binning approach identified 16 functional exonic rare variants in FANCC significantly associated with entorhinal cortex thickness (FDR-corrected p-value < 0.05). In addition, the approach identified 7 evolutionary conserved regions, which were mapped to FAF1, RFX7, LYPLAL1 and GOLGA3, significantly associated with entorhinal cortex thickness (FDR-corrected p-value < 0.05). In further analysis, the functional exonic rare variants in FANCC were also significantly associated with hippocampal volume and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ1-42 (p-value < 0.05). Our novel binning approach identified rare variants in FANCC as well as 7 evolutionary conserved regions significantly associated with a LOAD-related neuroimaging endophenotype. FANCC (fanconi anemia complementation group C) has been shown to modulate TLR and p38 MAPK-dependent expression of IL-1β in macrophages.

Smooth-Threshold Multivariate Genetic Prediction with Unbiased Model Selection.,Ueki M.; Tamiya G.;  .,"We develop a new genetic prediction method, smooth-threshold multivariate genetic prediction, using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) data in genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Our method consists of two stages. At the first stage, unlike the usual discontinuous SNP screening as used in the gene score method, our method continuously screens SNPs based on the output from standard univariate analysis for marginal association of each SNP. At the second stage, the predictive model is built by a generalized ridge regression simultaneously using the screened SNPs with SNP weight determined by the strength of marginal association. Continuous SNP screening by the smooth thresholding not only makes prediction stable but also leads to a closed form expression of generalized degrees of freedom (GDF). The GDF leads to the Stein's unbiased risk estimation (SURE), which enables data-dependent choice of optimal SNP screening cutoff without using cross-validation. Our method is very rapid because computationally expensive genome-wide scan is required only once in contrast to the penalized regression methods including lasso and elastic net. Simulation studies that mimic real GWAS data with quantitative and binary traits demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the gene score method and genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP), and also shows comparable or sometimes improved performance with the lasso and elastic net being known to have good predictive ability but with heavy computational cost. Application to whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) exhibits that the proposed method shows higher predictive power than the gene score and GBLUP methods.",2016,Apr,Genetic epidemiology,40,3,233-43,,10.1002/gepi.21958,26947266,#1504,Ueki 2016,"",""

We used cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma CLU levels as endophenotypes for genetic studies to understand the role of CLU in AD. CSF, but not plasma, CLU levels were significantly associated with AD status and CSF tau/amyloid-beta ratio, and highly correlated with CSF apolipoprotein E (APOE) levels.

On the subset of data for which we could obtain compatible genotype-level data (4,610 IS cases, 1,281 AD cases and 14,320 controls), we estimated the genome-wide genetic correlation (rG) between AD and IS, and the three subtypes (cardioembolic, small vessel, large vessel), using genome-wide SNP data. We then performed a meta-analysis and pathway analysis in the combined AD and small vessel stroke datasets to identify the SNPs and molecular pathways through which disease risk may be conferred.

Genetic heterogeneity of Alzheimer's disease in subjects with and without hypertension.,Nazarian A.; Arbeev KG.; Yashkin AP.; Kulminski AM.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by the interplay of multiple genetic and non-genetic factors. Hypertension is one of the AD risk factors that has been linked to underlying pathological changes like senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles formation as well as hippocampal atrophy. In this study, we investigated the differences in the genetic architecture of AD between hypertensive and non-hypertensive subjects in four independent cohorts. Our genome-wide association analyses revealed significant associations of 15 novel potentially AD-associated polymorphisms (P < 5E-06) that were located outside the chromosome 19q13 region and were significant either in hypertensive or non-hypertensive groups. The closest genes to 14 polymorphisms were not associated with AD at P < 5E-06 in previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Also, four of them were located within two chromosomal regions (i.e., 3q13.11 and 17q21.2) that were not associated with AD at P < 5E-06 before.
