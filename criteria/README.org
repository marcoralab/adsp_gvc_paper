* Inclusion criteria

- The phenotype is solely or mainly based on clinical diagnosis of AD
  (e.g., AD case/control status, age-at-onset of AD, or AD liability
  score). In addition to clinical diagnosis of AD, the phenotype can
  include other diagnostic measurements (e.g., neuropathological
  assessment or disease biomarkers).

- The study is a genome-wide association study of single variants or aggregations thereof.

- The article is published after 2015-01-01.

- The study is found in a search of the GWAS catalog or it is an ADSP paper in PubMed.

- The analysis includes at least 1,000 subjects.

* Exclusion criteria

- The phenotype is a specific non-AD dementias or an endophenotype.

- The phenotype is solely based on neuropathological or biomarker outcomes.

- The article is a review.

- The analysis is performed using a novel method.

- The analysis is stratified (e.g., by sex or APOE status).

* Tier assignment criteria

** Single variant, locus association analysis

*** Tier 1

**** Quality of analysis

- Are counfounding factors accounted for? For example, population structure, age, sex, race and ethnicity? *Yes*, No, Unable to eval

**** Strength of association

- pval of association < (0.05/# of tests)

**** Robustness of association

*** Tier 2

- pval of association < (1/# of tests)

** Single variant, gene mapping analysis

** Aggregate variant, locus association analysis

** Aggregate variant, gene mapping analysis
